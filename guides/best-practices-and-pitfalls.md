# ‚úÖ Best Practices & ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

Panduan untuk menghindari kesalahan umum dan mengoptimalkan penggunaan Cursor AI.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Context Management

#### ‚úÖ Do: Gradual Context Building
```
Step 1: "I'm building a user management system for a SaaS app"
Step 2: "Here's the current User model: @types/user.ts"
Step 3: "Now I want to add role-based permissions..."
```

#### ‚ùå Don't: Context Overload
```
‚ùå "Here are 15 files, please understand everything and build a complete authentication system with OAuth, 2FA, role management, audit logs, and password policies"
```

### 2. Request Specificity

#### ‚úÖ Do: Specific, Actionable Requests
```
‚úÖ "Refactor the calculatePrice function in @utils/pricing.ts to handle discount codes. It should:
- Accept a discountCode parameter
- Validate the code against our discount rules
- Apply percentage or fixed amount discounts
- Return both original and discounted prices"
```

#### ‚ùå Don't: Vague Requests
```
‚ùå "Make the pricing better"
‚ùå "Fix this bug"
‚ùå "Improve performance"
```

### 3. Error Communication

#### ‚úÖ Do: Complete Error Information
```
‚úÖ Error in checkout process:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add item to cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Enter payment details
4. Click "Pay Now"

Error message:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'total' of undefined
    at processPayment (checkout.ts:45)
    at handleSubmit (CheckoutForm.tsx:123)
```

Expected: Order should be processed successfully
Environment: Chrome 119, macOS, Production
```

#### ‚ùå Don't: Incomplete Error Reporting
```
‚ùå "Payment not working, help fix"
```

### 4. Code Quality Requests

#### ‚úÖ Do: Specify Quality Criteria
```
‚úÖ "Review this React component for:
- Performance optimization (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- TypeScript strictness
- Error boundary integration
- Mobile responsiveness"
```

#### ‚ùå Don't: Generic Quality Requests
```
‚ùå "Make this code better"
```

### 5. Testing Integration

#### ‚úÖ Do: Test-First Approach
```
‚úÖ "Write unit tests for the shopping cart functionality first, then implement:
- Add item to cart
- Remove item from cart
- Update quantity
- Calculate total with taxes
- Apply discount codes

Test framework: Jest + React Testing Library"
```

#### ‚ùå Don't: Afterthought Testing
```
‚ùå "Here's my finished code, now add some tests"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### 1. The "One-Shot" Trap

#### ‚ùå Pitfall:
```
"Please build a complete e-commerce application with user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, admin panel, and inventory management."
```

#### ‚úÖ Solution:
```
Break into smaller iterations:
1. "Set up basic project structure with authentication"
2. "Add product catalog with search functionality"
3. "Implement shopping cart with state management"
4. "Integrate payment processing"
etc.
```

### 2. The "Magic Code" Trap

#### ‚ùå Pitfall:
Accepting generated code without understanding it.

#### ‚úÖ Solution:
```
"Please explain how this authentication middleware works:
1. What security measures does it implement?
2. How does the token validation work?
3. What are the potential security vulnerabilities?
4. How should I test this in different scenarios?"
```

### 3. The "Context Loss" Trap

#### ‚ùå Pitfall:
Starting new conversations for related tasks without providing context.

#### ‚úÖ Solution:
```
Maintain context with:
- Reference previous work: "Building on the auth system we created earlier..."
- Use file references: "@components/auth/LoginForm.tsx that we just built"
- Provide project context: "This is for the SaaS dashboard we're building"
```

### 4. The "Copy-Paste" Trap

#### ‚ùå Pitfall:
Directly copying generated code without adaptation to your project.

#### ‚úÖ Solution:
```
"Adapt this authentication solution for our project:
- We use Supabase instead of Firebase
- Our user model has additional fields: company, role
- We need to integrate with our existing Redux store
- Follow our TypeScript strict configuration"
```

### 5. The "Over-Engineering" Trap

#### ‚ùå Pitfall:
```
AI: "I'll implement this with microservices architecture, event sourcing, CQRS, distributed caching, and auto-scaling containers..."
You: "Um, it's just a todo app..."
```

#### ‚úÖ Solution:
```
"Implement a simple todo app with:
- Basic CRUD operations
- Local storage persistence
- Simple, clean UI
- No complex architecture needed
- Focus on code clarity over fancy patterns"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Assurance Practices

### 1. Code Review Checklist

Always ask AI to review for:
```
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance implications
- Error handling completeness
- TypeScript type safety
- Testing coverage
- Documentation quality
- Accessibility compliance
- Mobile responsiveness
```

### 2. Testing Strategy
```
For each feature, request:
1. Unit tests for individual functions
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. Component tests for React components
4. E2E tests for critical user flows
5. Error scenario testing
```

### 3. Documentation Standards
```
Ensure AI provides:
- Clear function/component descriptions
- Usage examples
- Parameter documentation
- Error handling instructions
- Performance considerations
```

## üéØ Productivity Optimization

### 1. Template Usage
```
‚úÖ Create reusable templates for:
- Feature requests
- Bug reports
- Code reviews
- Testing scenarios
- Documentation requests
```

### 2. Batching Related Tasks
```
‚úÖ Instead of separate requests:
"Create login component"
"Add form validation"
"Add error handling"
"Add loading states"

‚úÖ Batch together:
"Create login component with form validation, error handling, loading states, and TypeScript types"
```

### 3. Incremental Improvement
```
‚úÖ Build iteratively:
Phase 1: Basic functionality
Phase 2: Error handling
Phase 3: Performance optimization
Phase 4: Advanced features
Phase 5: Testing & documentation
```

## üîç Debugging Best Practices

### 1. Systematic Approach
```
When reporting bugs:
1. Minimal reproduction case
2. Expected vs actual behavior
3. Environment details
4. Error messages with stack traces
5. Recent changes that might be related
```

### 2. Performance Issues
```
For performance problems:
1. Specific metrics (load time, bundle size, etc.)
2. Profiling data
3. User scenarios affected
4. Baseline measurements
5. Target performance goals
```

### 3. Integration Issues
```
For integration problems:
1. API endpoints involved
2. Data flow description
3. Authentication/authorization details
4. Error responses
5. Network timing issues
```

## üé® UI/UX Considerations

### 1. Design System Integration
```
‚úÖ "Create this component following our design system:
- Use our color tokens: primary-500, gray-100
- Follow spacing scale: 8px grid system
- Match our typography: font-sans, text-sm
- Include dark mode support
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design"
```

### 2. Accessibility Requirements
```
‚úÖ Always specify:
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management
```

### 3. Performance Considerations
```
‚úÖ Request optimization for:
- Bundle size impact
- Render performance
- Image optimization
- Lazy loading implementation
- Critical path prioritization
```

## üìä Success Metrics
