# üéØ Advanced Techniques untuk Cursor AI

Teknik-teknik lanjutan untuk memaksimalkan produktivitas dengan Cursor AI Agent.

## üîó Multi-File Context Management

### 1. File Referencing Strategy
```
Saya sedang refactor authentication system yang melibatkan:
- @components/auth/LoginForm.tsx - Form login utama
- @hooks/useAuth.ts - Custom hook untuk auth state
- @utils/authHelpers.ts - Helper functions
- @types/auth.ts - Type definitions

Please analyze the current implementation dan suggest improvements untuk:
1. Better error handling
2. Improved TypeScript types
3. More efficient state management
```

### 2. Cross-File Dependencies
```
Update the user management system:

1. Modify @types/user.ts to add 'lastLoginDate' field
2. Update @api/users.ts to handle the new field in API calls
3. Modify @components/UserProfile.tsx to display last login
4. Update @hooks/useUser.ts to track login timestamps
5. Add migration in @db/migrations/ for database schema

Please ensure all changes are consistent across files.
```

## üß† Context Accumulation Techniques

### 1. Progressive Context Building
```
Phase 1: "Let me show you the current user authentication flow"
[Show relevant files]

Phase 2: "Now I want to add two-factor authentication. Based on the existing flow, how should we implement this?"

Phase 3: "Great! Now let's also add social login options. How can we integrate this with the 2FA system we just designed?"
```

### 2. Context Anchoring
```
CONTEXT ANCHOR:
This is an e-commerce platform for Indonesian SMEs.
- Target users: Small business owners (non-technical)
- Main features: Inventory, orders, customer management
- Tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL

## üé® Advanced Prompt Patterns

### 1. The "Rubber Duck" Pattern
```
I'm going to explain my current problem as if you're a rubber duck, then ask for your expert input:

"I have this weird bug where user sessions expire randomly. I think it might be related to how I'm handling JWT tokens, but I'm not sure. The weird thing is it only happens in production, not in development..."

Now, as a senior developer, what questions would you ask me to debug this? And what are the most likely causes?
```

### 2. The "Architect Review" Pattern
```
Please put on your architect hat dan review this system design:

Current Architecture:

1. Scalability: Will this handle 10x traffic?
2. Maintainability: How will this affect code complexity?
3. Performance: Any potential bottlenecks?
4. Security: Are there any vulnerabilities?
5. Cost: Resource implications?

Provide a recommendation with pros/cons dan alternative approaches.
